### CSSTP Project 1

This project required me to familiarize myself with git by collaborating with classmates to create and edit a project repository. We established separate branches in order to make local changes, push them to respective branches on the remote repository, review these changes, merge them to the main branch, and pull them back to our local respository. In addition, I created this personal web page.
